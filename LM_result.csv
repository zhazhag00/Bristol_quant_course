Eli Lilly Profit, Revenue Increase


By Austen Hufford 

     Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said profit and revenue rose in its latest quarter as sales in its animal health business helped offset currency headwinds. 

     The 28% increase in animal health revenue also helped offset sharp declines in Cymbalta and Evista revenue, which fell 39% and 27%, respectively. Lilly bought the animal health unit from Novartis for about $5.4 billion in 2014. 

     Sales of Humalog, Lilly&apos;s biggest product by revenue, rose 10% to $798.7 million. 

     Like many companies that do significant business abroad, Lilly said the stronger U.S. dollar hurt sales. Adverse exchange rates shaved 6% off the top line but increased volume was responsible for 7% revenue growth with an additional 3% growth due to higher prices. 

     In all, Lilly reported a profit of $478.4 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $428.5 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, earnings per share fell to 78 cents from 82 cents. 

     Revenue grew 5% to $5.38 billion. Analysts projected 78 cents in adjusted per-share profit and $5.32 billion in sales. 

     Like its peers, the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant has been hurt by a wave of patent expirations. In prepared remarks on Thursday, Chief Executive John Lechleiter touted that the company received six Food and Drug Administration approvals for its drugs and &quot;multiple&quot; positive Phase 3 clinical trial results in 2015. 

     The company said it expects its bottom-line 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.83 to $2.93, down from its previous forecast of $2.92 to $3.02--but it backed its adjusted earnings per share guidance, the profit gauge Wall Street watches most closely, at $3.45 to $3.55. Lilly also said it still expects revenue of between $20.2 billion and $20.7 billion 

     Shares, which have fallen 1.6% in the last three months, were inactive premarket.

How Alexion Pharmaceuticals Could Double in 2017 -- Barron&apos;s Blog


 
 

  By Ben Levisohn 

  Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals ( ALXN) have dropped more than 35% this year as concerns about a whistleblower lead to the delay of its 10-Q and the departure of its CEO and CFO. Alexion&apos;s woes could make it a target for an acquisitive biotech giant like Gilead Sciences ( GILD)--and Leerink&apos;s Geoffrey Porges and Bradley Canino contends Alexion could actually double in 2017...with a little help. They explain: 

 

  We now regard the recent turmoil at Alexion as an opportunity for investors, rather than a material risk. Successive disclosures from the company suggest that personal and professional failings were behind the recent dismissal of the two most senior executives at the company, and the delay in the 10-Q is now primarily associated with new management completing their review of the results and operations such that they can sign-off on the filing. The risk of a material re-statement, or change in business outlook, now seems low in our view, and with the company&apos;s board and legacy management severely weakened, and investor sentiment very negative, the timing for activist involvement is immediate. Should the 10-Q be filed without material changes in business results or outlook, we believe the stock is likely to move up significantly and in the new year discussion about acquirer interest is likely to boost the stock materially higher than its current range. 

 
 

  Assuming the real tail of Soliris&apos; revenue potential is 2035, and not 2022, and giving the company an aggressive -10%/year terminal growth rate after 2035E, we calculate the core products and current expense outlook are worth $181/share. If we assume that the company&apos;s expense base is &quot;radically restructured&quot; to increase operating margins to 65% by 2021E rather than the 52% we currently forecast, our DCF increases to $223. Our analysis of the company&apos;s prior disclosure suggests that little or no value (from the current products) would be lost from such cuts, and the company would still have more than sufficient infrastructure and expense to complete the current trials with Soliris, transition the franchise to &apos;1210, maintain Strensiq, and provide a growing (more slowly) level of commercial support (with less overhead). Were an acquirer to purchase the company, we believe they would take an even more aggressive approach, removing all R&amp;D and SG&amp;A overhead, halting all research and capping commercial support, and spending at more or less at the current dollar range regardless of revenue growth. This would drive operating margins above 70% by 2021E (which is not out of line for incremental profitability of large specialty franchises), and we calculate the value of the cash flows, assuming Alexion&apos;s current tax rate and cost of capital (probably both too high for many acquirers), would be $252/share. 

 

  Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals have gained 1.4% to $120.60 at 10:37 a.m. today, while Gilead Sciences has dropped 1.2% to $73.05. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB) is off 0.5% at $266.49.

Philip Morris Boosts Outlook as Profit Falls -- Update


By Joshua Jamerson 

     Philip Morris International Inc. on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter results, citing tough comparisons, but boosted its profit forecast for the year as it sees currency headwinds waning. 

     For 2016, the cigarette maker raised its forecast earnings to a range of $4.40 to $4.50 a share on a reported basis, up from prior guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 a share, which includes special items. Still, the company&apos;s expectations were below Wall Street&apos;s projections; analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had anticipated $4.48 in earnings. 

     Philip Morris also said it expects most growth to come in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. 

     Shares slid 2.8% to $97.75 in premarket trading. 

     Philip Morris, which sells the leading Marlboro brand internationally, has seen its cigarette volumes grow lately as the European economy strengthens. 

     Andr&#233; Calantzopoulos, Philip Morris&apos;s chief executive, said the company&apos;s improved guidance reflects &quot;moderating industry volume declines and robust pricing,&quot; blaming the first-quarter results on an unfavorable comparison to the &quot;exceptionally strong&quot; year-ago quarter. 

     Philip Morris saw a $272 million benefit from higher pricing across all its regions, which helped drive 2.4% growth in revenue in the quarter, excluding currency impacts and acquisitions. 

     For the period ended March 31, cigarette volume fell 1.4% to 196 billion units, as 2.6% growth in the European Union, and 2.4% growth in Latin America and Canada was offset by a 7% slide in Asia. In the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa unit, shipment volume increased by 0.8%. 

     Over all, Philip Morris reported a profit of $1.53 billion, or 98 cents a share, down from $1.8 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $1.11. Revenue excluding excise taxes fell 8.1% to $6.08 billion, below the $6.34 billion in revenue analysts had forecast. 

     Shares edged down 0.4% to $100.20 a share in light premarket trading.

Apple May Send Cash to the U.S. -- WSJ


By Paul Hannon And Sam Schechner 

     Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company may repatriate at least some of the billions of dollars of cash it holds offshore as early as next year, in comments made in the wake of a EUR13 billion ($14.5 billion) tax clawback decision by European authorities. 

     Mr. Cook, who has aggressively challenged that ruling, took his case to Ireland on Thursday, blasting the decision as &quot;political crap&quot; and saying anti-competition authorities in Brussels miscalculated how much tax the company paid in Ireland. 

     &quot;They just picked a number from I don&apos;t know where,&quot; Mr. Cook told Ireland&apos;s Independent newspaper. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager responded Thursday by denying the decision was a political move, and she defended Brussels&apos; math. She said officials used figures Apple provided to them, as well as from a U.S. Senate hearing into the matter several years ago. 

     The European Union&apos;s antitrust regulator demanded Tuesday that Ireland recoup the taxes from Apple, alleging that arrangements the government offered the company in 1991 and 2007 allowed it to pay around 1% to almost zero tax on its European profits between 2003 and 2014. Apple said it would appeal the decision. Ireland&apos;s finance minister has also criticized the decision, but the government hasn&apos;t officially blessed an appeal. 

     The clawback decision at the EU has ratcheted up scrutiny in the U.S. of the huge stockpile of cash that Apple and other American companies hold offshore. Some U.S. politicians have fashioned the move as a European grab for that cash amid deadlock in Washington over how to change the corporate tax code to encourage companies to repatriate that money. 

     Apple holds about $215 billion in cash and other liquid investments offshore. It has long provisioned for an eventual repatriation of some of the funds. But Apple has also long suggested it wasn&apos;t considering moving any of that money back soon -- until there was corporate tax code changes in the U.S. that would make such a move less costly. Mr. Cook told the Washington Post in August that the company wouldn&apos;t bring the money back &quot;until there&apos;s a fair rate&quot; but said he was optimistic of corporate tax changes next year. 

     On Thursday, Mr. Cook, in an interview with Irish state radio broadcaster RT&#201;, said it could start repatriating that cash as early as next year. 

     &quot;We provisioned several billion dollars for the U.S. for payment as soon as we repatriate it, and right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year,&quot; Mr. Cook said in the interview. 

     An Apple spokeswoman said that Mr. Cook was referring to his optimism that the U.S. will change its tax code next year, and that his comments didn&apos;t represent any change to Apple&apos;s position on the question. 

     U.S. companies hold some $2 trillion in cash offshore, protected from U.S. taxes. Companies based in the U.S. are subject to 35% corporate tax rate on global profits when they bring that money home, though they can also get tax credits for payments to foreign governments. Many executives, including Apple, have said that rate is unfair. 

     Apple provisions each year U.S. income taxes on about half of its foreign earnings to cover such a repatriation. Currently those provisions total about $30 billion, Apple said. 

     The company reported in 2014 an effective tax rate of 26.1% on its world-wide profit, including the foreign tax provisions that are unpaid, a level Mr. Cook described as &quot;reasonable.&quot; 

     Mr. Cook also said in the radio interview that he expects Ireland&apos;s government will do &quot;the right thing&quot; and appeal the EU clawback ruling. He also said he expects Apple&apos;s own appeal against the European Union&apos;s decision to succeed. 

     &quot;I&apos;m very confident that the courts will take a nonpolitical view of this and come to the right decision,&quot; he said.

Merrill Lynch Broker Team With $550 Million in Assets Resigns -- Wealth Manager


By Veronica Dagher 

     Two Merrill Lynch brokers who managed $550 million in client assets have resigned to launch a boutique advisory focused on international clients, joining a number of small adviser groups to leave big firms to offer more specialized services. 

     Advisers Elizabeth van Walleghem and Thomas J. Butler III on Tuesday officially launched Maximai Investment Partners in Coral Gables, Fla. The firm is focused on ultra-high-net worth entrepreneurs and families from Latin America, Europe, the Caribbean and elsewhere. 

     Ms. van Walleghem had been at Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America Corp., since 1992. Mr. Butler worked at Merrill for 28 years. 

     A Merrill spokeswoman confirmed the departures. 

     About two years ago, the advisers started to search for another platform to serve clients. Many of their clients had been asking when they were going to start their own firm, Ms. van Walleghem says, largely because they desired more investment options. 

     The advisers determined that by going independent, they would have more flexibility to meet clients&apos; needs. &quot;The world is our oyster now as opposed to being limited by the boundary of four walls,&quot; Ms. van Walleghem said. 

     Last summer, Merrill trimmed its international effort to focus on 29 target countries, primarily Canada and in Latin America, and it curtailed brokers&apos; ability to travel outside the U.S. The company also announced that brokers who serve international clients would work as part of a specialized team and it raised the minimum account size that those overseas clients need to work with a Merrill broker. 

     Ms. van Walleghem says those policies played a role in the advisers&apos; decision to move. At Merrill, the advisers said they had a $2.5 million or $5 million account minimum for new clients depending on the country. Their new firm has a $1 million minimum, Ms. van Walleghem says. 

     Ms. van Walleghem will work primarily with clients from Venezuela, Peru, Chile, the Caribbean and Europe. Mr. Butler will focus on the firm&apos;s clients from Mexico, Central America and Brazil. 

     Also joining the advisers are three Merrill Lynch employees. They are launching the firm with the support of Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York-based firm that provides independent adviser teams access to a platform for trading, clearing, research and other support services. 

     Ms. van Walleghem says the advisers chose to work with Dynasty after hearing success stories from other international advisers who had left brokerage firms and gone independent. &quot;Knowing other similar advisers who made the move made me feel confident we could do it, too,&quot; she says.
